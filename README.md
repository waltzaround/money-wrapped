# Money Wrapped

Money Wrapped is your personal financial year-in-review, inspired by Spotify Wrapped. It analyzes your transaction history to create beautiful, insightful visualizations of your spending patterns throughout the year. Upload or connect your banking data securely, and discover fascinating insights about your financial habits - from your most frequent merchants to your biggest spending categories. 


## Local build instructions

If you don't have `pnpm` install that first

- run `pnpm dev` in the `/` root of the project
- open another terminal and run `pnpm dev` in the `/api-worker` directory to run the backend locally
- visit `http://localhost:5173` to see changes - they should live reload
