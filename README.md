## Local build instructions
=====

If you don't have `pnpm` install that first

- run `pnpm dev` in the `/` root of the project
- open another terminal and run `pnpm dev` in the `/api-worker` directory to run the backend locally
- visit `http://localhost:5173` to see changes - they should live reload
